# Lovecraft Happy Numbers

> Coding Exercise for Text & Code Class inspired by Angus Croll's 
> "If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript". 

## Purpose
This creative exercise was to write code as if you were a famous author. 
For this excerise I chose to impersonate H.P. Lovecraft writing a "Happy Numbers" code.

### Functionality
The code takes in a user's integer input through a console interface and decides whether the number is "Happy" or not if it can reach the number 1 by repeatedly taking the squares of its digits after an amount of attempts. 

### Example
Input: $$19$$
Iteration 1: $$ 1^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 81 = 82 $$
Iteration 2: $$ 8^2 + 2^2 = 64 + 4 = 68 $$
Iteration 3: $$ 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100 $$
Iteration 3: $$ 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 $$
